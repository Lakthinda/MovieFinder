Assumptions
-	Both APIs produce same responses – Used same data objects (Ex: Movie, MovieDetail, and MovieList) but The solution is designed so we can change different data objects easily based on different API responses
-	Movie Titles are same in both APIs
-	APIs are flaky

Future Improvements
-	Improve the UI for better user experience
-	Add Search movies bar component – this can search from MovieList object already available in React
